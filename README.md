# Bubble Sort Visualization

![Bubble Sort Visualization](bubble-sort-demo.gif)

## Overview

This project provides an interactive visualization of the bubble sort algorithm. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This visualization allows users to see how the sorting process unfolds in real-time.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Watch as elements are compared, swapped, and sorted visually.
- **Real-time Updates:** Bars representing array elements change color to indicate their current status (comparison, swapping, sorted).
- **Start and Stop Controls:** Buttons to start and stop the sorting animation, providing hands-on learning.
- **Educational Tool:** Helps in understanding sorting algorithms and their complexity (O(n^2) in worst-case scenario).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS:** Structuring and styling the visualization interface.
- **JavaScript:** Implementing the bubble sort algorithm and controlling the animation.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Updating the UI in real-time based on algorithm execution.
